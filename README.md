### Notes

This repo is a notebook with various lessons related to either ML or mathematics with Python. The notebooks contained in the repo are mostly jupyter notebooks. Each is focused on some specific method or function or idea.

'doing-math' is a random hodge-podge of math related Python exercises. 'neural-nets-notes' is similarly various operations that are useful for machine learning applications and 'numpy notebook' is similarly, various snippets for numpy operations.

Please feel free to make use of the code. 

### References
The notebooks are created as I am teaching myself. Sources vary, however, I am making use of other repositories and books, for which I'm grateful for the reference and availability. 

These include:
- Numerical Python published by Apress and written by Robert Johansson. [The repo for this book is available on Github](https://github.com/Apress/Numerical-Python-3rd-ed)
- Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, available on Coursera and [here on Github](https://github.com/greyhatguy007/Machine-Learning-Specialization-Coursera)
- Hands on Machine Learning by Aur√©lien Geron, available via O'Reiley and [here on Github](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3)

I will continue to update these references as I go.
